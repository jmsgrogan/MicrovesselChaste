<h3>Miniboxing for Breeze and Spire</h3>

<p>A very tricky question in compilers is how to translate high level
generic code, such as classes with type parameters to optimized low
level code. Researchers have proposed many translations in the last 25
years, yet we can&#39;t claim to have a perfect solution. This is because
generic code is uniform at a high level, but its low level translation
requires optimized non-uniform representations to obtain good
performance. Thus we have an inherent tension between uniformity and
optimality.</p>

<p>In the context of the Java Virtual Machine, <a href="http://scala-miniboxing.org/">miniboxing</a> is a new
translation that sidesteps the shortcomings of previous approaches,
while maintaing the optimality of the low level non-uniform code. It
builds on the specialization transformation, which is already included
in the <a href="http://github.com/scala/scala">Scala compiler</a>, but produces too much bytecode to be
useful in practical applications. Although miniboxing is developed for
the Scala language, the same transformation could also be implemented
in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html">Java</a> and in other JVM languages, such as <a href="http://x10-lang.org">IBM&#39;s X10</a>,
<a href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/">JetBrains&#39; Kotlin</a>  and <a href="http://ceylon-lang.org/">RedHat&#39;s Ceylon</a>.</p>

<p>The miniboxing transformation matches optimal performance in
microbenchmarks, but in order to make a significant impact in the
Scala community, it needs to be prove itself on large benchmarks, such
as the <a href="https://github.com/non/spire">spire numeric abstractions library</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze">breeze numeric
processing library</a>. In this context, the tasks for this project
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>develop the necessary mechanisms around the miniboxing plugin to
allow running the spire and breeze benchmarks</li>
<li>identify slowdowns caused by the miniboxing translation and</li>
<li>propose and implement solutions to improve the performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project requires familiarity with compilers (requirement: having
taken at least a basic Compilers course), the Scala programming language
(requirement: having taken the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming in Scala</a>
course) and with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java bytecode</a>. Note that acceptance for this
project is conditioned by the successful completion of a challenge,
which will be explained once you apply for the project. A big plus is
having contributed to OSS software written in Scala.</p>

<h3>MacroGL library</h3>

<p>OpenGL is a cross-language, multi-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D
computer graphics. The API interacts with a GPU to achieve
hardware-accelerated rendering. OpenGL is used heavily in the industry
and is constantly evolving. On the JVM, namely Scala and Java, you can
currently use OpenGL by relying either on the JOGL library (Java
OpenGL) or LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library). Both libraries are
low-level bindings on top of OpenGL - these libraries are ports of the
C-like OpenGL API to Java.</p>

<p>While this is highly configurable, programming with these low-level
constructs may be cumbersome.</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenGL state has to be manually set up before performing the desired
task, and then reverted to previous state once the task is done</li>
<li>Creating OpenGL objects like buffers, textures or shader programs
requires a large number of API calls and imperative state changes,
while it could be done declaratively for typical programs</li>
<li>Communicating values to shader programs requires imperative API
calls and dealing with the layout of shader variables in the OpenGL
programs</li>
<li>Error states have to be queried manually and there are not
exceptions being thrown, let alone error messages other than numeric
error codes.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this results in a lot of boilerplate code that is hard to understand, maintain and debug.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/storm-enroute/macrogl">MacroGL library</a> is a
high-level API that allows writing more structured, yet efficient
OpenGL code. Here are some of its features.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It provides structured constructs for setting transformation
matrices, OpenGL settings, textures, programs, buffers, and in
general setting up the rendering pipeline</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">for {
  _ &lt;- enabling(GL_CULL_FACE)
  _ &lt;- using.matrix(scene.camera.projectionMatrix)
  _ &lt;- using.matrix(scene.camera.modelviewMatrix)
  _ &lt;- using.texture(GL_TEXTURE0, shadowChannel)
  b &lt;- using.framebuffer(screenBuffer)
  _ &lt;- b.attachTexture2D(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_0, screenChannel, 0)
} objectBuffer.render()
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>

<p>These for-comprehensions use Scala Macros to inline the
  state-handling code and avoid object allocations for closures.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It prefers convention over configuration when declaratively
instantiating OpenGL objects like shaders:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">val glowFilter = new Program("glowfilter")(
  Program.Shader.Vertex(resources("glowfilter.vert")),
  Program.Shader.Fragment(resources("glowfilter.frag"))
)
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>It allows easy communication between the Scala program and the
shaders:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">glowFilter.uniform.width = width
glowFilter.uniform.height = height
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Supports Vector and Matrix types</p></li>
<li><p>easier error querying</p></li>
<li><p>easy access to many rendering pipeline settings</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The current MacroGL functionality is, however, restricted to core
OpenGL features. We would like to extend the library to completely
cover the OpenGL API. Some of the features missing:
- texture types - 1D, 3D, cube maps, texture arrays, mipmapping
- tessellation and geometry shaders
- implementing missing buffer types and consolidating the existing
  buffer types
- facilities efficiently uploading images to textures
- we want to use the quasiquoting features of Scala 2.11 to simplify
  macros in MacroGL and bring them more up-to-date
- optional exception throwing when an error state is detected,
  governed by ErrorPolicy typeclasses (must be turned off for
  performance after development)
- structured constructs for geometry rendering
- allow a richer set of uniform variable types for shaders (currently
  MacroGL API only supports integers, floats, float vectors and float
  matrices)
- avoiding boxing in some places, such as setting uniform variables
  for shaders
- implementing more Vector and Matrix types (e.g. integers), divide
  them into mutable and immutable versions
- parsing common 3d model formats and producing buffers</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to provide a set of higher-level
abstractions and a Scala-based API that works with JOGL, while in the
same time retaining most of the performance and efficiency of
JOGL. This should allow Scala programmer to write safer and more
reliable OpenGL code which is also easier to understand and maintain.</p>

<p>The final goal is to produce and document a usable, concise and
powerful open source library for writing OpenGL programs more
efficiently in Scala. Deliverables are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>implemented most of missing features described above and merged them
into the main distribution</p></li>
<li><p>MacroGL ported from Scala 2.10 to Scala 2.11, leaving 2.11 as the
development version</p></li>
<li><p>detailed documentation in form of a GitHub page, containing API
docs, overview of different features with descriptions, a getting
started guide, and several example use cases</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Generic XML interpolator</h3>

<p>Scala features XML literals which desugar to calls of the XML
library. The support for XML literals is part of the parser and the
compiler, and are bound to a single desugared API. Scala 2.10 added
support for generic, customizable string interpolators. Standard ones
are <code>s&quot;foo = $foo&quot;</code> or <code>f&quot;bar = $bar%.2f&quot;</code>.
<a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/quasiquotes.html">Quasi-quotes</a>,
added in Scala 2.11, show that these interpolators can be implemented by
macros to support compile-time checking of the syntax inside an
interpolator.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to design and implement a macro-based
generic XML string interpolator. It should be primarily designed as a
replacement for the XML literal syntax of Scala, and hence would
provide at least all the features of that syntax. For example, the XML
literals</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">val name = "John"
val span = &lt;span&gt;{ name }&lt;/span&gt;
val node = &lt;div&gt;{ span }&lt;/div&gt;
node match { case &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;{ inner }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; =&gt; inner }
</code></pre></div>
<p>could be rewritten as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">val name = "John"
val span = xml"&lt;span&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;"
val node = xml"&lt;div&gt;$span&lt;/div&gt;"
node match { case xml"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;$inner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" =&gt; inner }
</code></pre></div>
<p>As an additional requirement, this interpolator should be generic with
respect to the actual API that is called by the generated code, called
the &quot;back-end&quot;. As a possible example, on <a href="http://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a> we would
like to have XML literals that create DOM elements directly instead of
<code>scala.xml</code> objects. The details on how to make the interpolator
generic are not specified, and you are encouraged to come up with a
smart idea to solve that requirement. You are not required to actually
provide a second back-end besides that targeting the <code>scala.xml</code> API,
but your implementation should allow others to do so without modifying
the code.</p>

<p>Required skills:
* Good working knowledge of Scala
* Good knowledge of XML
* Basic knowledge of <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/overview.html">def macros</a></p>

<h3>Slick: Type-checking of plain SQL</h3>

<p>Slick supports the use of Plain SQL queries as a thin execution layer
on top of JDBC. This requires that users not only write their own SQL
code but also know the result type of the query and how to map that
back to Scala types. There is also no compile-time checking for these
kinds of queries.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to alleviate both issues with the use of
macros. Plain SQL queries based on string interpolation have all the
necessary information (query string, parameter types) available at
compile-time to allow a macro-based implementation to send the query
to a database for verification, get the result type from the database,
and translate that back into a Scala type. As an implementer of such a
feature you will have to come up with practical solutions for
configuring the database access for the macro, caching the database
results for good performance, and ensuring that the solution would be
usable in environments that cannot expand the macro (e.g. some
IDEs). You will have to work towards these goals with the Slick team
and possibly the Scala Macros implementers.</p>

<h3>Runtime Expansion for Scala Macros</h3>

<p>Scala macros are functions called by the compiler during program
compilation. Since their inception in Scala 2.10, macros are widely
used in libraries and domain-specific languages to analyze and
generate code.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always been a number of interesting extensions to our macro
system that we planned to experiment with, and here&#39;s one of
them. Even though macros look and quack like normal methods, they are
not first-class. This brings problems when compile-time information
alone is not sufficient to perform macro expansion, preventing macros
from being effectively used for runtime code generation. The main goal
of this project is to remove this restriction and implement runtime
macros - functions that produce executable code during program runtime
using familiar macro APIs.</p>

<p>When working on the project you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design syntax for designating runtime-expandable expressions in code</li>
<li>Figure out changes to the macro engine and reflection APIs that are
necessary to enable runtime macro expansion</li>
<li>Experiment with and deliver runtime macro expansion for Scala macros</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Beware! There&#39;s already been a lot of applications for this project!
Luckily there are other macro-related ideas to hack on during GSoC.
Contact Eugene for more information.</em></p>

<h3>Refactor Scaladoc&#39;s Scalac dependencies</h3>

<p>Scaladoc currently has strong dependencies on the Scala compiler&#39;s internal classes.
Large parts of it could be refactored to use reflection instead in order to loosen its ties
with the compiler. Part of this task is identifying the smallest remaining required interface
to the scala compiler classes.</p>

<p>Mentored by @cvogt http://people.epfl.ch/christopher.vogt</p>

<h3>Refactor Scaladoc to allow generating generate other documentation format</h3>

<p>Scaladoc currently only generates the default html format. Other formats could be
several of single file plain HTML, multi file plain HTML, pdf, CHM, dash doclet...
This requires cooperation with the other Scaladoc project.
This could help: https://github.com/szeiger/extradoc
This is Scala compiler related project.</p>

<h3>Projects with Breeze</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.github.com/scalanlp/breeze">Breeze</a> is a high-performance
linear algebra library for Scala that uses . The ideas here generally
require a fairly advanced knowledge of Scala. In general, experience
with frameworks like NumPy or languages like R, MatLab, and Julia
would be immensely valuable as well. Other projects related to
numerical computing and linear algebra are encouraged. Please
introduce yourself on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze">group&#39;s mailing</a> list with any ideas.</p>

<p>All Breeze projects are mentored by
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Edlwh/">David Hall</a></p>

<h4>Multi-dimensional Arrays</h4>

<p>Breeze currently only supports 1-dimensional vectors and 2-dimensional
matrices. Frameworks like <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> support arbitrarily dimensioned
arrays. This is easier in dynamically typed languages that don&#39;t
enforce correctness at compile time, because Scala does not provide
mechanisms for abstracting over the &quot;arity&quot; of types. Nevertheless,
we&#39;d like to extend support to arbitrarily dimensioned arrays. This
project would involve the creation of a new high-order array type,
with keys based on a flexible data type, like Shapeless HLists, as
well as support functions for manipulating these arrays, with the
ultimate goal being parity with
<a href="http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial#head-6a1bc005bd80e1b19f812e1e64e0d25d50f99fe2">NumPy&#39;s multidimensional arrays</a>.</p>

<p>More concretely, the student would create the new data structure,
along with array creation (e.g. zeros, ones) and manipulation routines
(e.g. roll, ravel), as well as operator (e.g. addition and
subtraction) and universal function (e.g. exp, sum) support, following
the design patterns used in Breeze.</p>

<p>The ideal student would have a strong command of Scala, familiarity
with NumPy, and some familiarity with <a href="http://github.com/milessabin/shapeless">Shapeless</a>. The student
would work closely with the maintainers of Breeze. Interested students
should introduce themselves on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze">group&#39;s mailing list</a>.</p>

<h4>Spire/Algebird Interoperability</h4>

<p>There are currently a number of different math libraries for
Scala. <a href="http://github.com/non/spire">Spire</a> (and, to a lesser extent, Algebird) have fairly
fleshed out algebraic hierarchies for Rings, Semirings, Monoids, and
the like. Breeze has its own parallel hierarchy, but it is less
developed. In this project, the student would bridge these different
libraries, either by integrating Spire&#39;s data types into Breeze, or by
introducing implicit conversions to provide an interoperability
layer. Students should have an intermediate knowledge of Scala
(e.g. how to write implicits to provide implementation), and some
familiarity with or interest in abstract algebra (i.e. what a ring is,
and how it relates to a field). The deliverables for this project
would include</p>

<ol>
<li>a proposed plan for either interoperability and integration with
Spire and</li>
<li>an implementation of the plan.</li>
</ol>

<p>If time permits, we would then consider adding interoperability with
other libraries likes Algebird. The student would work closely with the
maintainers of Breeze. Interested students should introduce themselves
on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze">group&#39;s mailing list</a>.</p>

<h4>GPU Extensions for Breeze</h4>

<p>GPUs have recently become popular for scientific computing due to
their high performance and ubiquity. In this project, the student
would extend Breeze to provide wrappers for third-party GPU computing
libraries like <a href="http://www.jcuda.org/jcuda/jcublas/JCublas.html">JCublas</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javacl/">JavaCL</a>. Breeze is designed to
be flexible enough to support this kind of extension, so this project
should not require changing too much of the core of Breeze, though of
course it is a large undertaking nonetheless. The student would
propose a design, backed by either of the two implementations, and
then an implementation for common linear algebra operations, along
with a design document for extending their work.</p>

<p>This project requires intermediate knowledge of Scala (e.g. how to
write implicits to provide implementation), access to either a CUDA-
or OpenCL-compatible device, and some familiarity with GPU
computing. The student would work closely with the maintainers of
Breeze. Interested students should introduce themselves on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze">group&#39;s mailing list</a>.</p>

<h4>Visualization Library</h4>

<p>Languages for scientific computing are often accompanied by a great
library for visualizing data. In this project, the student would
design and implement such a framework for Scala and Breeze. There is
<a href="http://github.com/scalanlp/breeze-viz">some work</a> in this direction, but this project would require a strong
design sense from the student. Students should have an intermediate
knowledge of Scala, and experience using or implementing visualization
libraries like <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a>, or <a href="http://dcjones.github.io/Gadfly.jl/">gadfly</a>.</p>

<p>The deliverables include a specification of the overall design
(e.g. API use cases, proposed architecture and backend), a
proof-of-concept implementation that can be fleshed out into a more
complete library, and a tutorial for using this library. The student
would work closely with the maintainers of Breeze. Interested students
should introduce themselves on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze">group&#39;s mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements and Guidelines</h2>

<h3>General Student Application Requirements</h3>

<p>This is the fifth time the Scala project has applied to the Summer of
Code, and from last years experience, increased popularity of the
language and stories of other mentor organizations we expect a high
number of applications. First, be aware of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Make sure that you understand, fulfill and agree to the general
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page">Google Summer of Code rules</a></li>
<li>  The work done during GSoC requires some discipline from the
students as they have to plan their day-to-day activities by
themselves. Nevertheless we expect regular contact with the
mentors by the usual forms of communication (mail, chat, phone) to
make sure that the development is going according to the plan and
students don&#39;t get stuck for weeks at a time (3 months may seem
long, but in reality it is very easy to run out of time).</li>
<li>  The <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014">official SoC timetable</a>
mentions May 19th as the official start of coding, but if you
have time you are encouraged to research your proposals even
before that (and definitely learn the basics of Scala, if you
haven&#39;t done that already).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Student Application Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
<li>  Student proposals should be very specific. We want to see evidence
that you can succeed in the project. Applications with one-liners
and general descriptions definitely won&#39;t make the cut.</li>
<li>  Because of the nature of our projects students must have at some
knowledge of the Scala language. Applicants with Scala programming
experience will be preferred. Alternatively, experience with
functional programming could suffice, but in your application we
want to see evidence that you can quickly be productive in Scala.</li>
<li>  You can think of Google Summer of Code as a kind of independent
internship. Therefore, we expect you to work full-time during the
duration. Applicants with other time commitments are unlikely to
be selected. From our previous experience we know that students&#39;
finishing their studies (either Bachelor, Master of PhD) are
likely to be overwhelmed by their final work, so please don&#39;t be
too optimistic and carefully plan your time for the project.</li>
<li>  If you are unsure whether your proposal is suitable, feel free to
discuss it on our
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language">&quot;scala-language&quot;</a>
mailing list. We have many community members on our mailing list
who will quickly answer any of your questions regarding the
project. Mentors are also constantly monitoring the mailing
list. Don&#39;t be afraid of asking questions, we enjoy solving
puzzles like that!</li>
</ul>

<h3>General Proposal Requirements</h3>

<p>The proposal will be submitted via the standard web-interface at
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014">http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014</a>,
therefore plain text is the best way to go. We expect your application
to be in the range of 700-1500 words. Anything less than that will
probably not contain enough information for us to determine whether
you are the right person for the job.</p>

<p>Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but
feel free to include anything that you think is relevant:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Please include your name (weird as it may be, people do forget
about it)</li>
<li>  Title of your proposal</li>
<li>  Abstract of your proposal</li>
<li>  Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why is
it innovative (maybe you already have some prototype?), what
contribution do you expect to make to the Scala community and why
do you think your project is needed, a rough plan of your
development and possible architecture sketches.</li>
<li>  Description of previous work, existing solutions (links to
prototypes, bibliography are more than welcome!)</li>
<li>  Write us about yourself and convince us that you are the right
person for the job (linking to your resume/CV is good but not
sufficient)

<ul>
<li>  Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous
work, internships</li>
<li>  Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal
(programming languages, frameworks)?</li>
<li>  Any previous open-source projects (or even previous GSoC) you
have contributed to?</li>
<li>  Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may
affect you work? Any vacations/holidays planned? Please be
specific as much as you can.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>  Contact details (<strong>very important!</strong>)</li>
</ul>
