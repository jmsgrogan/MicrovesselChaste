abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric peptide growth factor which binds to two structurally related tyrosine kinase receptors denoted Flt1 and KDR. In order to compare the signal transduction via these two receptors, the human Flt1 and KDR proteins were stably expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Binding analyses using 125I-VEGF revealed Kd values of 16 pM for Flt1 and 760 pM for KDR. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were found to express two distinct populations of binding sites with affinities similar to those for Flt1 and KDR, respectively. The KDR expressing cells showed striking changes in cell morphology, actin reorganization and membrane ruffling, chemotaxis and mitogenicity upon VEGF stimulation, whereas Flt1 expressing cells lacked such responses. KDR was found to undergo ligand-induced autophosphorylation in intact cells, and both Flt1 and KDR were phosphorylated in vitro in response to VEGF, however, KDR much more efficiently than Flt1. Neither the receptor-associated activity of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase nor tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma were affected by stimulation of Flt1 or KDR expressing cells, and phosphorylation of GTPase activating protein was only slightly increased. Members of the Src family such as Fyn and Yes showed an increased level of phosphorylation upon VEGF stimulation of cells expressing Flt1 but not in cells expressing KDR. The maximal responses in KDR expressing porcine aortic endothelial cells were obtained at higher VEGF concentrations as compared to HUVE cells, i.e. in the presence of Flt1. This difference could possibly be explained by the formation of heterodimeric complexes between KDR and Flt1, or other molecules, in HUVE cells.},

abstract = {In this review we summarize our recent efforts in trying to understand the role of heterogeneity in cancer progression by using neural networks to characterise different aspects of the mapping from a cancer cells genotype and environment to its phenotype. Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving system subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these processes to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple biological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the microenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the cell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways that are regulated by the genotype. Integrating all of these processes is a massive undertaking and requires bridging many biological scales (i.e. genotype, pathway, phenotype and environment) that we will only scratch the surface of in this review. We will focus on models that use neural networks as a means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to easily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this heterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More specifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different aspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the impact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from genotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway activity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The systems biology community is building increasingly complex models and simulations of cells and other biological entities, and are beginning to look at alternatives to traditional representations such as those provided by ordinary differential equations (ODE). The lessons learned over the years by the software development community in designing and building increasingly complex telecommunication and other commercial real-time reactive systems, can be advantageously applied to the problems of modeling in the biology domain. Making use of the object-oriented (OO) paradigm, the unified modeling language (UML) and Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling (ROOM) visual formalisms, and the Rational Rose RealTime (RRT) visual modeling tool, we describe a multi-step process we have used to construct top-down models of cells and cell aggregates. The simple example model described in this paper includes membranes with lipid bilayers, multiple compartments including a variable number of mitochondria, substrate molecules, enzymes with reaction rules, and metabolic pathways. We demonstrate the relevance of abstraction, reuse, objects, classes, component and inheritance hierarchies, multiplicity, visual modeling, and other current software development best practices. We show how it is possible to start with a direct diagrammatic representation of a biological structure such as a cell, using terminology familiar to biologists, and by following a process of gradually adding more and more detail, arrive at a system with structure and behavior of arbitrary complexity that can run and be observed on a computer. We discuss our CellAK (Cell Assembly Kit) approach in terms of features found in SBML, CellML, E-CELL, Gepasi, Jarnac, StochSim, Virtual Cell, and membrane computing systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider ANSI C program slicing using XML (Extensible Markup Language). Our goal is to build a flexible, useful and uniform data interchange format for CASE tools, which is a key issue to make it much easier to develop CASE tools such as program slicers. Although XML has a great potential for such data interchange formats, we first point out that there are still a lot of challenging problems to be solved. Then, as a first step to our goal, we introduce ACML (ANSI C Markup Language), which describes the syntactic structure and static semantics for ANSI C code. In our preliminary experiment, we had a good result; it took only 0.5 man-month to implement Weiser's slicer based on ACML, whereas it took about 2 man-months to implement an ANSI C parser and static semantics analyzer of XCI (Experimental C Interpreter).},

Previously, we examined the requirements for a reference conceptual model to guide semantic integration based on the systemic principles. In the present paper, we examine the usefulness of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) to describe and specify biological systems and processes. This makes unambiguous representations of biological systems, which would be suitable for translation into mathematical and computational formalisms, enabling analysis, simulation and prediction of these systems behaviours.},

abstract = {Solid tumors require blood vessels for growth, and many new cancer therapies are directed against the tumor vasculature. The widely held view is that these antiangiogenic therapies should destroy the tumor vasculature, thereby depriving the tumor of oxygen and nutrients. Here, I review emerging evidence supporting an alternative hypothesis-that certain antiangiogenic agents can also transiently "normalize" the abnormal structure and function of tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen and drug delivery. Drugs that induce vascular normalization can alleviate hypoxia and increase the efficacy of conventional therapies if both are carefully scheduled. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vascular normalization may ultimately lead to more effective therapies not only for cancer but also for diseases with abnormal vasculature, as well as regenerative medicine, in which the goal is to create and maintain a functionally normal vasculature.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has gained popularity over the past few years for the analysis of complex models arising in population genetic, epidemiology and system biology. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a set of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. In cases where it is possible to estimate the Fisher information we can construct particularly efficient perturbation kernels. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy-examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problem in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal models. We conclude with a general discussion of rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

abstract = {The 1966 science-fiction film Fantastic Voyage captured the public imagination with a clever idea: What fantastic things might we see and do if we could miniaturize ourselves and travel through the bloodstream as corpuscles do? (This being Hollywood, the answer was that we'd save a fellow scientist from evildoers.)A generation later, many wonder why we'd go to the trouble of shrinking ourselves. Now we can easily "see" into blood vessels, into cells themselves, with nanosize detectors, DNA assays, digital imaging tools and advanced microscopes. We have only to turn on the television to take a digitally simulated voyage deep into the body of a crime victim. And scientists have the tools to examine life at almost any scale imaginable-to scan the solar system for biomolecules., monitor changes in global vegetation from satellites, watch blood flow inside the brain or locate a point mutation in a chromosome.But that's the problem with biology. Life has so many scales, each rich and complex, that progress has required the field to be sliced up. Some scientists are molecular biologists, others cellular, organismic or population biologists; still others study broad issues emerging from the perspectives of evolution, ecology or bioinformatics. Biology at each level incorporates information from strata above and below. With tools and resources ample enough to parse whole genomes, our view of life is no longer limited by our instruments.But information can easily outrace the theory needed to understand it. As each layer of life becomes more transparent, what is revealed is more complexity than could have been imagined. Consider the brain, astoundingly complex from its convoluted outer folds right down to the intricate chemistry and nanosecond networking capabilities of its neurons. Ponder malaria, a disease involving the complex life cycles, behavior and genetics of host, pathogen and vector, not to mention climate and evolutionary factors, predators, coinfection and the like. Or, finally, cancer, a destructive disorder arising over time and space from the complex genetics and environmental interactions of animal cells.Firmly rooted in observation and experiment, biology for decades had little use for mathematical modeling, which was, in any event, a slow business until computers made it possible to simulate large complex systems of nonlinear equations. Today biologists and mathematicians desperately need each other-not just to find structure in the vast quantities of data flowing from experiment but also to integrate this information into models that explain at multiple scales of time and space how life works. Trees branch, fish grow scales, bacterial colonies form dendritic patterns, birds flock, tumors invade organs, grasses colonize a bare riverbank. Much of life is emergent, a complex system growing out of the interaction of simple elements. New tools are helping us see the regulatory and adaptive properties that characterize all biological phenomena. With the computing power to harness some of the data now available, and with insights offered from old and new mathematics, modelers are making progress on many fronts.},

abstract = {Cancer is viewed as a multistep process whereby a normal cell is transformed into a cancer cell through the acquisition of mutations. We reduce the complexities of cancer progression to a simple set of underlying rules that govern the transformation of normal cells to malignant cells. In doing so, we derive an ordinary differential equation model that explores how the balance of angiogenesis, cell death rates, genetic instability, and replication rates give rise to different kinetics in the development of cancer. The key predictions of the model are that cancer develops fastest through a particular ordering of mutations and that mutations in genes that maintain genomic integrity would be the most deleterious type of mutations to inherit. In addition, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the parameters included in the model to determine the probable contribution of each. This paper presents a novel approach to viewing the genetic basis of cancer from a systems biology perspective and provides the groundwork for other models that can be directly tied to clinical and molecular data.},

The model represents an inceptive attempt to address the question of how unchecked sprouting of the parent vessel is avoided at the initiation of angiogenesis, based on the idea that feedback regulation processes play the dominant role. No chemical interaction between the proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors is assumed. The model is based on corneal pocket experiments, and provides a mathematical analysis of the initial spacing of angiogenic sprouts.},

abstract = {Normal human colonic microvascular endothelial cells (HUCMEC) have been isolated from surgical specimens by their adherence to Ulex europaeus agglutinin bound to magnetic dynabeads that bind $\alpha$-l-fucosyl residues on the endothelial cell membrane. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of a range of endothelial-specific markers on HUCMEC, including the von Willebrand factor, Ulex europaeus agglutinin, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. The growing cells form monolayers with the characteristic cobblestone morphology of endothelial cells and eventually form tube-like structures. HUCMEC produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and express the receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) and fms-like tyrosine kinase, through which VEGF mediates its actions in the endothelium. VEGF induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR and a proliferative response from HUCMEC comparable to that elicited from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). On binding to HUCMEC or HUVEC, 125I-labeled VEGF internalizes or dissociates to the medium. Once internalized,125I-labeled VEGF is degraded and no evidence of ligand recycling was observed. However, significantly less VEGF is internalized, and more is released to the medium from HUCMEC than HUVEC. Angiogenesis results from the proliferation and migration of microvascular, not large-vessel, endothelial cells. The demonstration that microvascular endothelial cells degrade less and release more VEGF to the medium than large-vessel endothelial cells identifies a mechanism permissive of the role of microvascular cells in angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis, the growth of a network of blood vessels, is a crucial component of solid tumour growth, linking the relatively harmless avascular growth phase and the potentially fatal vascular growth phase. As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration, proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel (sprout) formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is blood flow associated with the nascent network, the subsequent growth of the network evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix and perfusion-related haemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this paper we present a mathematical model which simultaneously couples vessel growth with blood flow through the vessels-dynamic adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (DATIA). This new mathematical model presents a theoretical and computational investigation of the process and highlights a number of important new targets for therapeutic intervention. In contrast to earlier flow models, where the effects of perfusion (blood flow) were essentially evaluated a posteriori, i.e. after generating a hollow network, blood flow in the model described in this paper has a direct impact during capillary growth, with radial adaptations and network remodelling occurring as immediate consequences of primary anastomoses. Capillary network architectures resulting from the dynamically adaptive model are found to differ radically from those obtained using earlier models.The DATIA model is used to examine the effects of changing various physical and biological model parameters on the developing vascular architecture and the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the tumour. Subsequent simulations of chemotherapeutic treatments under different parameter regimes lead to the identification of a number of new therapeutic targets for tumour management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we discuss a theoretical framework for volumetric growth suitable for modeling the growth of soft tissues exhibiting the properties of a solid. After a proper kinematic decomposition, balance equations for mass, momentum and energy are discussed together with constitutive relationships. The mathematical model is then applied to avascular tumor growth. We show by numerical simulation that, under assumption of spherical symmetry, the mathematical model is able to reproduce the experimental data with a satisfying qualitative agreement.},

abstract = {There is currently limited understanding of the role played by haemodynamic forces on the processes governing vascular development. One of many obstacles to be overcome is being able to measure those forces, at the required resolution level, on vessels only a few micrometres thick. In the current paper, we present an in silico method for the computation of the haemodynamic forces experienced by murine retinal vasculature (a widely used vascular development animal model) beyond what is measurable experimentally. Our results show that it is possible to reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional geometrical models directly from samples of retinal vasculature and that the lattice-Boltzmann algorithm can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the haemodynamics in these domains. Our findings show that the flow patterns recovered are complex, that branches of predominant flow exist from early development stages, and that the pruning process tends to make the wall shear stress experienced by the capillaries increase by removing redundant segments. We believe that the methodology developed herein is applicable to other biomedical domains where microcirculation can be imaged but experimental flow measurements are unavailable or difficult to obtain.},

abstract = {The biology of cancer is a complex interplay of many underlying processes, taking place at different scales both in space and time. A variety of theoretical models have been developed, which enable one to study certain components of the cancerous growth process. However, most previous approaches only focus on specific aspects of tumour development, largely ignoring the influence of the evolving tumour environment. In this paper, we present an integrative framework to simulate tumour growth, including those model components that are considered to be of major importance. We start by addressing issues at the tissue level, where the phenomena are modelled as continuum partial differential equations. We extend this model with relevant components at the cellular or even sub-cellular level in a vertical fashion. We present an implementation of this framework, covering the major processes and treat the mechanical deformation due to growth, the biochemical response to hypoxia, blood flow, oxygenation and the explicit development of a vascular system in a coupled way. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and its applicability to in silico studies of the influence of different treatment strategies (like the usage of novel anti-cancer drugs) for more effective therapy design.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessel from existing ones, is a pivotal stage in cancer development, and is an important target for cancer therapy. We develop a hybrid mathematical model to understand the mechanisms behind tumor-induced angiogenesis. This model describes uptake of Tumor Angiogenic Factor (TAF) at extracellular level, uses partial differential equation to describe the evolution of endothelial cell density including TAF induced proliferation, chemotaxis to TAF, and haptotaxis to extracellular matrix. In addition we also consider the phenomenon of blood perfusion in the micro-vessels. The model produces sprout formation with realistic morphological and dynamical features, including the so-called brush border effect, the dendritic branching and fusing of the capillary sprouts forming a vessel network. The model also demonstrates the effects of individual mechanisms in tumor angiogenesis: Chemotaxis to TAF is the key driving mechanisms for the extension of sprout cell; endothelial proliferation is not absolutely necessary for sprout extension; haptotaxis to ExtraCellular Matrix (ECM) gradient provides additional guidance to sprout extension, suggesting potential targets for anti-angiogenic therapies.

One of these key capabilities is increased motility which is needed for invasion of other tissues and metastasis. This paper presents a qualitative mathematical model based on game theory and computer simulations using cellular automata. With this model we study the circumstances under which mutations that confer increased motility to cells can spread through a tumour made of rapidly proliferating cells. The analysis suggests therapies that could help prevent the progression towards malignancy and invasiveness of benign tumours.},

abstract = {The advantage of Cellular Potts Model (CPM) is due to its ability for introducing cell-cell interaction based on the well known statistical model i.e. the Potts model. On the other hand, Lattice gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) can simulate movement of cell in a simple and correct physical way. These characters of CPM and LGCA have been combined in a reaction-diffusion frame to simulate the dynamic of avascular cancer growth on a more physical basis.The cellular automaton is evolved on a square lattice on which in the diffusion step tumor cells (C) and necrotic cells (N) propagate in two dimensions and in the reaction step every cell can proliferate, be quiescent or die due to the apoptosis and the necrosis depending on its environment. The transition probabilities in the reaction step have been calculated by the Glauber algorithm and depend on the KCC, KNC, and KNN (cancer-cancer, necrotic-cancer, and necrotic-necrotic couplings respectively). It is shown the main feature of the cancer growth depends on the choice of magnitude of couplings and the advantage of this method compared to other methods is due to the fact that it needs only three parameters KCC, KNC and KNN which are based on the well known physical ground i.e. the Potts model.

abstract = {Computing the stationary distribution of a large finite or countably infinite state space Markov Chain has become central to many problems such as statistical inference and network analysis. Standard methods involve large matrix multiplications as in power iteration, or simulations of long random walks, as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For both methods, the convergence rate is is difficult to determine for general Markov chains. Power iteration is costly, as it is global and involves computation at every state. In this paper, we provide a novel local algorithm that answers whether a chosen state in a Markov chain has stationary probability larger than some $\Delta \in (0,1)$, and outputs an estimate of the stationary probability for itself and other nearby states. Our algorithm runs in constant time with respect to the Markov chain, using information from a local neighborhood of the state on the graph induced by the Markov chain, which has constant size relative to the state space. The multiplicative error of the estimate is upper bounded by a function of the mixing properties of the Markov chain. Simulation results show Markov chains for which this method gives tight estimates.},

abstract = {Motivation: Estimating parameters from data is a key stage of the modelling process, particularly in biological systems where many parameters need to be estimated from sparse and noisy data sets. Over the years, a variety of heuristics have been proposed to solve this complex optimisation problem, with good results in some cases yet with limitations in the biological setting. Results: In this work, we develop an algorithm for model parameter fitting that combines ideas from evolutionary algorithms, sequential Monte Carlo and direct search optimisation. Our method performs well even when the order of magnitude and/or the range of the parameters is unknown. The method refines iteratively a sequence of parameter distributions through local optimisation combined with partial resampling from a historical prior defined over the support of all previous iterations. We exemplify our method with biological models using both simulated and real experimental data and estimate the parameters efficiently even in the absence of a priori knowledge about the parameters.},

abstract = {Chronic wounds represent a major public health problem affecting 6.5 million people in the United States. Ischemia represents a serious complicating factor in wound healing. In this paper we analyze a recently developed mathematical model of ischemic dermal wounds. The model consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in the partially healed region, with the wound boundary as a free boundary. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is assumed to be viscoelastic, and the free boundary moves with the velocity of the ECM at the boundary of the open wound. The model equations involve the concentrations of oxygen, cytokines, and the densities of several types of cells. The ischemic level is represented by a parameter which appears in the boundary conditions, 0 <= gamma < 1; gamma near 1 corresponds to extreme ischemia and gamma = 0 corresponds to normal non-ischemic conditions. We establish global existence and uniqueness of the free boundary problem and study the dependence of the free boundary on gamma.},

abstract = {There is a very strong link between the vascularization of a tumour and the spread of the disease, both locally and to distant sites (Gimbrone et al., 1974, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 52, 413-27; Muthukkaruppan et al., 1982, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 69, 699-704; Ellis {\&} Fiddler, 1995, Lancet 346, 388-9). A tumour becomes vascularized by a process known as angiogenesis. Tumour angiogenesis is initiated by the release of diffusible substances by the tumour, whereby neighbouring capillary vessels are stimulated to grow and eventually penetrate the tumour. Anti-angiogenesis has been proposed as a potential strategy for the treatment of cancer (Folkman, 1995, Nature Med. 1, 21-31; Harris et al., 1996, Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 38, 97-108). In this paper, a mathematical model of the development of the tumour vasculature is presented. By suitable manipulation of the model parameters, we simulate various anti-angiogenesis strategies and we examine the roles that haptotaxis and chemotaxis may play during the growth of the neovasculature. The model is simulated in two space dimensions (on a square domain) so that it is, in theory, experimentally reproducible and any predictions of the model can therefore be tested.},

abstract = {The optimal selection of experimental conditions is essential to maximizing the value of data for inference and prediction, particularly in situations where experiments are time-consuming and expensive to conduct. We propose a general mathematical framework and an algorithmic approach for optimal experimental design with nonlinear simulation-based models; in particular, we focus on finding sets of experiments that provide the most information about targeted sets of parameters. Our framework employs a Bayesian statistical setting, which provides a foundation for inference from noisy, indirect, and incomplete data, and a natural mechanism for incorporating heterogeneous sources of information. An objective function is constructed from information theoretic measures, reflecting expected information gain from proposed combinations of experiments. Polynomial chaos approximations and a two-stage Monte Carlo sampling method are used to evaluate the expected information gain. Stochastic approximation algorithms are then used to make optimization feasible in computationally intensive and high-dimensional settings. These algorithms are demonstrated on model problems and on nonlinear parameter estimation problems arising in detailed combustion kinetics.

The model combines several previously identified components in a consistent framework, including neoplastic tissue growth, blood and oxygen transport, and angiogenic sprouting. First experiments with the framework and comparisons with observations made on solid tumors in vivo illustrate the plausibility of the approach. Explanations of several experimental observations are naturally provided by the model. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a model coupling tumor growth and angiogenesis.},

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. View full abstract},

abstract = {A celebratory panel took place at the 22nd International Conference on object-oriented programming, systems, languages, and applications in Montreal. The occasion was the 20th anniversary of Fred Brooks' paper "no silver bullet: essence and accidents of software engineering." Fred suggested that useful solutions must address inherent complexity observing that object-oriented techniques have come closest to achieving this goal. David described a "silver bullet" as a technique that requires no training or experience to apply a silver bullet should find its mark without aim. Software engineering as a discipline has expanded significantly, both in terms of system complexity and the community's global extent. "no silver bullet" continues to be both an enjoyable must-read and an influential reference. People use languages without the ideas, so the object community still has much to do. It is nice to know that, when all else fails us, we have an innate decision-making tool to fall back on. View full abstract},

abstract = {In this paper we deal with a semilinear hyperbolic chemotaxis model in one space dimension evolving on a network, with suitable transmission conditions at nodes. This framework is motivated by tissue-engineering scaffolds used for improving wound healing. We introduce a numerical scheme, which guarantees global mass densities conservation. Moreover our scheme is able to yield a correct approximation of the effects of the source term at equilibrium. Several numerical tests are presented to show the behavior of solutions and to discuss the stability and the accuracy of our approximation.},

abstract = {Online parameter identification is of importance, e.g., for model predictive control. Since the parameters have to be identified simultaneously to the process of the modeled system, dynamical update laws are used for state and parameter estimates. Most of the existing methods for infinite dimensional systems either impose strong assumptions on the model or cannot handle partial observations. Therefore we propose and analyze an online parameter identification method that is less restrictive concerning the underlying model and allows for partial observations and noisy data. The performance of our approach is illustrated by some numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) has formed a canonical example of tumourigenesis ever since its use in Fearon and Vogelstein's linear model of genetic mutation, and continues to generate a huge amount of research interest. Over time, the field has witnessed a transition from solely experimental work to the inclusion of mathematical and computational modelling. The fusion of these disciplines has the potential to provide valuable insights into oncologic processes, but also presents the challenge of uniting many diverse perspectives. Furthermore, the cancer cell phenotype defined by the `Hallmarks of Cancer' has been extended in recent times and provides an excellent basis for future research. The authors present a timely summary of the literature relating to CRC, addressing the traditional experimental findings, summarising the key mathematical and computational approaches, and emphasising the role of the Hallmarks in current and future developments. The authors conclude with a discussion of interdisciplinary work, outlining areas of experimental interest which would benefit from the insight that theoretical modelling can provide.

abstract = {Migration of cells in higher organisms is mediated by adhesion receptors, such as integrins, that link the cell to extracellular-matrix ligands, transmitting forces and signals necessary for locomotion. Whether cells will migrate or not on a given substratum, and also their speed, depends on several variables related to integrin-ligand interactions, including ligand levels, integrin levels, and integrin-ligand binding affinities. These and other factors affect the way molecular systems integrate to effect and regulate cell migration. Here we show that changes in cell migration speed resulting from three separate variables-substratum ligand level, cell integrin expression level, and integrin-ligand binding affinity-are all quantitatively predictable through the changes they cause in a single unifying parameter: short-term cell-substratum adhesion strength. This finding is consistent with predictions of a mathematical model for cell migration. The ligand concentration promoting maximum migration speed decreases reciprocally as integrin expression increases. Increases in integrin-ligand affinity similarly result in maximal migration at reciprocally lower ligand concentrations. The maximum speed attainable, however, remains unchanged as ligand concentration, integrin expression, or integrin-ligand affinity vary, suggesting that integrin coupling with intracellular motors remains unaltered.},

The model allows both temporal and two-dimensional spatial evolution of the system under investigation and is comprised of biological cell metabolism rules derived from both the experimental and mathematical modeling literature. We present numerical simulations that display behaviors which are qualitatively similar to those exhibited in tumor-immune system interaction experiments. These include spherical tumor growth, stable and unstable oscillatory tumor growth, satellitosis and tumor infiltration by immune cells. Finally, the relationship between these different growth regimes and key system parameters is discussed.},

abstract = {Mathematical models of tumor-immune interactions provide an analytic framework in which to address specific questions about tumor-immune dynamics. We present a new mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions, focusing on the role of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells in tumor surveillance, with the goal of understanding the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection. The model describes tumor-immune cell interactions using a system of differential equations. The functions describing tumor-immune growth, response, and interaction rates, as well as associated variables, are developed using a least-squares method combined with a numerical differential equations solver. Parameter estimates and model validations use data from published mouse and human studies. Specifically, CD8+ T-tumor and NK-tumor lysis data from chromium release assays as well as in vivo tumor growth data are used. A variable sensitivity analysis is done on the model. The new functional forms developed show that there is a clear distinction between the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the variable to which the model is most sensitive is patient specific, and can be measured with a chromium release assay. The variable sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may positively respond to treatment. Computer simulations highlight the importance of CD8+ T-cell activation in cancer therapy.},

We further introduce a novel technique for approximately marginalizing GP hyperparameters, yielding marginal predictions robust to hyperparameter mis-specification. Our method offers an efficient means of performing GP regression, quadrature, or Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional spaces.},

abstract = {A new definition of scale-space is suggested, and a class of algorithms used to realize a diffusion process is introduced. The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the `no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image View full abstract},

abstract = {Chemotaxis is the process by which cells behave in a way that follows the chemical gradient. Applications to bacteria growth, tissue inflammation, and vascular tumors provide a focus on optimization strategies. Experiments can characterize the form of possible chemotactic sensitivities. This paper addresses the recovery of the chemotactic sensitivity from these experiments while allowing for nonlinear dependence of the parameter on the state variables. The existence of solutions to the forward problem is analyzed. The identification of a chemotactic parameter is determined by inverse problem techniques. Tikhonov regularization is investigated and appropriate convergence results are obtained. Numerical results of concentration dependent chemotactic terms are explored.},

abstract = {In the development of multiscale biological models it is crucial to establish a connection between discrete microscopic or mesoscopic stochastic models and macroscopic continuous descriptions based on cellular density. In this paper a continuous limit of a two-dimensional Cellular Potts Model (CPM) with excluded volume is derived, describing cells moving in a medium and reacting to each other through both direct contact and long range chemotaxis. The continuous macroscopic model is obtained as a Fokker-Planck equation describing evolution of the cell probability density function. All coefficients of the general macroscopic model are derived from parameters of the CPM and a very good agreement is demonstrated between CPM Monte Carlo simulations and numerical solution of the macroscopic model. It is also shown that in the absence of contact cell-cell interactions, the obtained model reduces to the classical macroscopic Keller-Segel model. General multiscale approach is demonstrated by simulating spongy bone formation from loosely packed mesenchyme via the intramembranous route suggesting that self-organizing physical mechanisms can account for this developmental process.},

abstract = {This paper presents an efficient method for automatic detection and extraction of blood vessels in retinal images. Specifically, we also delineate vascular intersections/crossovers. The proposed algorithm is composed of four steps: matched filtering, local entropy thresholding, length filtering, and vascular intersection detection. The purpose of matched filtering is to enhance the blood vessels. Entropy-based thresholding can well keep the spatial structure of vascular tree segments. Length filtering is used to remove misclassified pixels. The algorithm has been tested on twenty ocular fundus images, and experimental results are compared with those obtained from a state-of-the-art method and hand-labeled ground truth segmentations.

abstract = {Although not a traditional experimental ``method,'' mathematical modeling can provide a powerful approach for investigating complex cell signaling networks, such as those that regulate the eukaryotic cell division cycle. We describe here one modeling approach based on expressing the rates of biochemical reactions in terms of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We discuss the steps and challenges in assigning numerical values to model parameters and the importance of experimental testing of a mathematical model. We illustrate this approach throughout with the simple and well-characterized example of mitotic cell cycles in frog egg extracts. To facilitate new modeling efforts, we describe several publicly available modeling environments, each with a collection of integrated programs for mathematical modeling. This review is intended to justify the place of mathematical modeling as a standard method for studying molecular regulatory networks and to guide the non-expert to initiate modeling projects in order to gain a systems-level perspective for complex control systems.},

abstract = {Relativistic causality has dramatic consequences on the measurability of nonlocal variables and poses the fundamental question of whether it is physically meaningful to speak about the value of nonlocal variables at a particular time. Recent work has shown that by weakening the role of the measurement in preparing eigenstates of the variable it is in fact possible to measure all nonlocal observables instantaneously by exploiting entanglement. However, for these measurement schemes to succeed with certainty an infinite amount of entanglement must be distributed initially and all this entanglement is necessarily consumed. In this work we sharpen the characterisation of instantaneous nonlocal measurements by explicitly devising schemes in which only a finite amount of the initially distributed entanglement is ever utilised. This enables us to determine an upper bound to the average consumption for the most general cases of nonlocal measurements. This includes the tasks of state verification, where the measurement verifies if the system is in a given state, and verification measurements of a general set of eigenstates of an observable. Despite its finiteness the growth of entanglement consumption is found to display an extremely unfavourable exponential of an exponential scaling with either the number of qubits needed to contain the Schmidt rank of the target state or total number of qubits in the system for an operator measurement. This scaling is seen to be a consequence of the combination of the generic exponential scaling of unitary decompositions combined with the highly recursive structure of our scheme required to overcome the no-signalling constraint of relativistic causality.

This paper formulates blood flow through a capillary network induced by a solid tumor and fluid flow in a tumor's surrounding tissue and investigates the effects of consideration a remodeled network and adaptability of capillary on interstitial flow. Numerical results show that the prediction of interstitial pressure for the remodeled network shows a higher value compared to the rigid one. Results from interstitial fluid and blood distribution in normal and cancerous tissues have beneficial information about the prediction of successive drug delivery. View full abstract},

abstract = {Macromolecular transport through the interstitial space of a tissue occurs by convection and diffusion. The convective component of transport results from interstitial fluid flow. There have been no direct measurements of the magnitude or direction of interstitial fluid flow in tissues to date. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we have measured interstitial fluid velocities and the diffusion coefficient of bovine serum albumin in normal and neoplastic tissues grown in a thin, transparent window in the ear of a rabbit. A well-defined laser beam was focused on a region within the interstitium of the fluorescence-bathed tissue. A short pulse of laser irradiation extinguished the fluorescence emanating from this selected region. The recovery of fluorescence due to diffusion and convection within the medium was monitored and analyzed to yield values of the diffusion coefficient and the fluid velocity. The average fluid velocity was about 0.6 microns/s, and albumin diffusion coefficients were 5.8 +/- 1.3 x 10(-7) cm2/s and 6.3 +/- 1.9 x 10(-7) cm2/s in normal and neoplastic tissues, respectively. The interstitial fluid flow, in general, was directed into postcapillary venules. The results obtained in this study should provide the impetus for further investigation into the diffusion and convection in various tissues under normal and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Mechanical interactions between cell and substrate are involved in vital cellular functions from migration to signal transduction. A newly developed technique, traction force microscopy, makes it possible to visualize the dynamic characteristics of mechanical forces exerted by fibroblasts, including the magnitude, direction, and shear. In the present study such analysis is applied to migrating normal and transformed 3T3 cells. For normal cells, the lamellipodium provides almost all the forces for forward locomotion. A zone of high shear separates the lamellipodium from the cell body, suggesting that they are mechanically distinct entities. Timing and distribution of tractions at the leading edge bear no apparent relationship to local protrusive activities. However, changes in the pattern of traction forces often precede changes in the direction of migration. These observations suggest a frontal towing mechanism for cell migration, where dynamic traction forces at the leading edge actively pull the cell body forward. For H-ras transformed cells, pockets of weak, transient traction scatter among small pseudopods and appear to act against one another. The shear pattern suggests multiple disorganized mechanical domains. The weak, poorly coordinated traction forces, coupled with weak cell-substrate adhesions, are likely responsible for the abnormal motile behavior of H-ras transformed cells.},

abstract = {There has been a great deal of interest in the mechanism of lamellipodial protrusion (Pollard, T., and G. Borisy. 2003. Cell. 112:453-465). However, one of this mechanism's endpoints, the force of protrusion, has never been directly measured. We place an atomic force microscopy cantilever in the path of a migrating keratocyte. The deflection of the cantilever, which occurs over a period of approximately 10 s, provides a direct measure of the force exerted by the lamellipodial leading edge. Stall forces are consistent with approximately 100 polymerizing actin filaments per micrometer of the leading edge, each working as an elastic Brownian ratchet and generating a force of several piconewtons. However, the force-velocity curves obtained from this measurement, in which velocity drops sharply under very small loads, is not sensitive to low loading forces, and finally stalls rapidly at large loads, are not consistent with current theoretical models for the actin polymerization force. Rather, the curves indicate that the protrusive force generation is a complex multiphase process involving actin and adhesion dynamics.},

When transport processes on a surface dominate over diffusion, finite element methods tend to be unstable unless the mesh is sufficiently fine. The paper introduces a stabilized finite element formulation based on the SUPG technique. An error analysis of the method is given. Results of numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the performance of the stabilized method.},

abstract = {Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a pluripotent cytokine with a wide range of target cells. Heparan sulfate binds bFGF, and this interaction has been demonstrated to protect bFGF against physical denaturation and protease degradation. The high concentrations of heparan sulfate in basement membranes have implicated these matrices as storage sites for bFGF in vivo. However, the mechanisms by which basement membranes modulate bFGF storage and release is unknown. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we have developed experimental and mathematical models of extracellular growth factor transport through basement membrane. Intact Descemet's membranes isolated from bovine corneas were mounted within customized diffusion cells and growth factor transport was measured under a variety of conditions that decoupled the diffusion process from the heparan sulfate binding phenomenon. Transport experiments were conducted with bFGF and interleukin 1beta. In addition, bFGF-heparan sulfate binding was disrupted in diffusion studies with high ionic strength buffer and buffers containing protamine sulfate. Transport of bFGF was enhanced dramatically when heparan sulfate binding was inhibited. This process was modeled as a problem of diffusion with fast reversible binding. Experimental parameters were incorporated into a mathematical model and independent simulations were run that showed that the experimental data were accurately predicted by the mathematical model. Thus, this study indicated that basement membranes function as dynamic regulators of growth factor transport, allowing for rapid response to changing environmental conditions. The fundamental principles controlling bFGF transport through basement membrane that have been identified here might have applications in understanding how growth factor distribution is regulated throughout an organism during development and in the adult state.},

abstract = {Various in vitro models have been described that emulate one or more of the processes involved in angiogenesis in vivo. In the present study endothelial cells were cultured in three-dimensional type I collagen lattices in the presence of a mixture of basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, and phorbol myristate acetate. Under these conditions, the endothelial cells rapidly assemble into an interconnected network of tube-like structures with a high frequency of intercellular canals or lumens. The formation of the networks and lumens was completely blocked by cycloheximide and by actinomycin D. Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD31 or vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) inhibited the formation of endothelial tubes. A subtle difference in the morphology of cells treated with anti-CD31 versus anti-VE-cadherin was noted; namely, cells incubated in the presence of CD31 antibodies were rounded or formed attenuated tube-like structures, both of which were characterized by a single, large intra- or intercellular vacuole. In contrast, tube formation by cells incubated in the presence of VE-cadherin antibodies was also impaired and, most notably, demonstrated a reduction in either vacuole formation or vacuole fusion, depending upon the monoclonal antibody used. We suggest that the two endothelial-junction-associated proteins, CD31 and VE-cadherin, play different roles in the process of tube formation. CD31 appears to be required for cell elongation, migration, and/or invasion in the gels as well as for cell-cell association to form the network structures. VE-cadherin also appears to be required for cell-cell association, but additionally appears to play some role in the process of vacuolization or vacuole fusion leading to intercellular lumen formation.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a simple mathematical model that adequately accounts for at least the initial vasculature that is established in a melanoma transplant. It is assumed that the tumor produces a substance (tumor angiogenesis factor--TAF) that elicits capillary sprouts from the vascular bed of the host. These sprouts then invade the tumor along the gradient of TAF and cross-connect forming a vascular pathway that is similar to the experimental patterns observed in a hamster cheek pouch. This model is then extended to include the migration of loops. The rupture and formation of sprouts from these loops is assumed to depend on the strength of the stimulus (TAF). Under the assumption that the production of TAF is significantly reduced in a neighborhood of an established vessel, the network formed by the vessels in the tumor corresponds to the observed arboreal patterns.},
