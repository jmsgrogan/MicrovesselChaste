\section*{Abstract}
Microvessel Chaste is an open-source software library for multi-scale agent-based modelling of tissues with microvessels. Development has focused on applications in spatial modelling of vascular tumours and wound healing. Problems of interest in these areas involve modelling blood flow, evolving vessel network geometries and topologies, and vessel interactions with diffusible chemicals. This library integrates discrete representations of microvessels with re-usable components for agent-based modelling in the open-source Chaste library, such as discrete cells, meshes and ordinary and partial differential equation (ODE/PDE) solvers. The aims of the library are to facilitate i) rapid model composition from a range of interchangeable sub-models, ii) management of a large number of input parameters from various literature sources and iii) integration of modelling with experimental observations. These aims are pertinent in the area of discrete vascular tissue modelling, where the authors believe that model cross-comparison and experimental validation are still in their early stages. This article includes simple example applications of the library, which can be run on a desktop computer. The source code is available to download under an open-source Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licence at \url{https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/PaperTutorials/Microvessel}\footnote{Login required. Username: reviewer. Password: paper}, together with details of a mailing list and links to documentation and tutorials.

\section*{Introduction}
Cancer, Heart And Soft Tissue Environment (Chaste)~\cite{Mirams2013} is an open-source C++ library for problems in computational physiology and biology. Chaste has been widely used in cardiac electrophysiology~\cite{Cooper2015} models and in developing multi-scale agent-based tissue models for developmental biology~\cite{Tetley2016} and cancer~\cite{Dunn2016}. Microvessel Chaste is an `add-on' project for Chaste, with functionality for including discrete microvessels in agent-based tissue models.

There are many dedicated software frameworks for agent-based cell modelling, including Chaste, CompuCell3D~\cite{Swat2012}, EPISIM~\cite{Sutterlin2013} and PhysiCell~\cite{Macklin2012}, however to the authors' knowledge, there is no similar framework for agent-based modelling of tissue with microvessels. Such computational models are widely used in vascular tumour and wound healing~\cite{Owen2011}, vascular patterning~\cite{Secomb2013} and orthopaedic~\cite{Carlier2012} modelling. Multi-scale agent-based modelling of tissue with microvessels introduces several requirements in addition to those of cell modelling software. For example, i) centre-line or spatially resolved representations of vessels are needed in place of point or centre-based representations of cells, ii) blood flow and chemical transport problems are solved in vessel networks with constantly evolving vessel geometry and connectivity and iii) new vessels may form and migrate based on mechanical and chemical cues. 

There are many notable bespoke computational models of tissue microvascaulture, including Anderson and Chaplain~\cite{Anderson1998}, Friboes \emph{et al.}~\cite{Frieboes2007}, Shirinifard \emph{et al.}~\cite{Shirinifard2009}, Welter and Rieger~\cite{Welter2013}, Secomb \emph{et al.}~\cite{Secomb2013}, and Boas and Merks~\cite{Boas2015}, aimed at answering specific questions. Our aim is to develop general software with the following attributes: i) availability under a permissive open-source license, ii) API documentation and user tutorials, iii) capability for on- and off-lattice modelling of vessels in arbitrary geometries in two and three dimensions and iv) use of object-oriented programming for \emph{extensibility}. In addition, the software is based on C++ for computational \emph{efficiency} and Boost Units~\cite{boost161} for compile-time dimensional analysis, input parameter management and improved \emph{reliability}. 

The aforementioned attributes allow future utilization of the library in addressing two outstanding challenges in tissue microvascaulture modelling. \emph{First}, the importance of rapidly constructing and cross-comparing multi-scale agent-based models of tissue microvascaulture is well recognized, as are the challenges in developing software for such an endeavour~\cite{Rieger2015, Connor2012}. Due to a lack of open-source, documented software, it is currently necessary to re-implement each computational model before application, delaying comparison studies and reducing reproducibility. \emph{Second}, there is now a wealth of high resolution three-dimensional (3D) experimental imaging data against which model predictions can be compared~\cite{Tozer2004}. To fully exploit these data it is necessary that 3D tissue regions of reasonable volume with realistic geometries can be simulated, as per Grogan \emph{et al.}~\cite{Grogan2016}. There are few approaches developed for this purpose in the literature. This functionality is available in the Microvessel Chaste library, including previously unpublished methods for 3D off-lattice modelling of sprouting angiogenesis.  

While the authors have previously developed and applied a range of multi-scale agent-based microvessel models in the areas of cancer~\cite{Alarcon2006, Perfahl2011, Grogan2016} and angiogenesis~\cite{Connor2015}, their incorporation in Microvessel Chaste is the first time such models have been made available open-source, with documentation and tutorials. Code design and implementation are discussed in the next section, followed by two sample applications. 	

\section*{Design and Implementation}

This section briefly summarizes available algorithms by demonstrating how the library can be used to construct and solve a typical multi-scale agent-based microvessel problem. Dedicated articles, such as Mirams~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Mirams2013}, should be consulted for further details on algorithms related to core Chaste functionality, including discrete cell modelling. At present, the library can be used with Linux only, with virtual machines required for use on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. To install Microvessel Chaste it is necessary to build from source after downloading and setting up dependencies. 

\subsection*{Algorithm Overivew}

The library is designed for composing multi-scale agent-based tissue problems with microvessels using on- and off-lattice representations of cells and vessels. While the library attempts to minimize the imposition of a definitive model structure on the user, it is helpful when introducing algorithms to consider a concrete use case. 

Fig~\ref{fig1} shows how the library can be used to \emph{compose} a problem of interest in vascular tumour modelling. For further details on models of this type the reader is referred to Owen \emph{et al.}~\cite{Owen2011}. Here, an initial vessel network and cell population are constructed, transport partial differential equations (PDEs) for diffusible chemicals configured, and rules for vessel growth or shrinkage due to blood flow defined, along with rules for vessel sprouting and endothelial tip cell migration in a stimulus field. The ability to compose a model from a collection of sub-models is noted. There is a high degree of interaction between components. Once a domain, which is a geometrical feature in two dimensions (2D) or 3D, is defined it can be used in the construction of vessel networks and cell populations through multiple space-filling or boolean operations, and in the generation of a computational grid (mesh) for use in the solution of PDEs. Sub-models can be collected in hierarchical structures, for example a \textit{StructuralAdaptationSolver} can manage a \textit{FlowSolver} and is itself managed by a \textit{MicrovesselSolver}. Alternatively, sub-models can be executed in isolation, for example to simply solve a nutrient PDE with cell location dependent sink terms.

\begin{figure}[!h]

A schematic showing the composition of a vascular tumour growth model using Microvessel Chaste. The ability to compose a model from a collection of sub-models is noted.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Fig~\ref{fig2} shows how the library can be used to \emph{solve} a problem of interest in vascular tumour modelling. Again, it is emphasised that the user need not follow the shown solution ordering, but can decide on ordering themselves by suitably over-riding \textit{Solve()} and \textit{Increment()} methods. The steps on the left-hand side of Fig~\ref{fig2} are already implemented as part of the agent-based cell modelling in Chaste~\cite{Mirams2013}. The Microvessel Chaste library interacts with the cell-based solver as a plug-in (called a \textit{SimulationModifier} in Chaste), by modifying the contents of a cell population once per time step. In the example problem shown in Fig~\ref{fig2}, vessels interact with (non-vessel) cells only via their shared influence on the solutions of chemical transport problems. Cell birth, death and cell-cycle progression can be affected by the PDE solution, which is sampled by each cell during the \textit{CellDataUpdate()} step. More detailed interactions, such as cell-vessel spatial occlusion, or forming vessels from collections of discrete cells, are also possible.

\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Code Layout And Design}

The components of the library are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item geometry -- code for generating and describing 2D and 3D geometries using piecewise linear complex (PLC) descriptions for direct use in Tetgen~\cite{Si2015} meshing software,
	\item mesh -- code for automated finite element meshing of 2D and 3D geometries and interpolation of vessel and cell locations onto meshes and regular grids,
	\item ode -- ordinary differential equation (ODE) models for cell-cycling,
	\item pde -- descriptions and solvers for steady state linear and non-linear PDEs with discrete sinks and sources for vessels and cells. Solvers use finite differences, finite element methods and Green's function methods~\cite{Secomb2013} based on Boost uBLAS and PETSc for vector and matrix operations,
	\item population -- code for describing, reading, writing and generating vessel networks,
	\item simulation -- flow, structural adaptation and angiogenesis solvers. Also code for managing integration of discrete vessel simulations with discrete cell populations from Chaste,
	\item utility -- dimensional analysis and a collection of literature parameters of interest for tissue microvascualture simulations.	
\end{itemize}

Object-oriented programming, including templating in C++, are utilized throughout the library. Input and output of vessel networks, grids and PDE results are in VTK (Paraview) format, which allows use of standard tools for visualization and post-processing. Python bindings are generated automatically using Py++ with a CASTXML back-end. Pre-compiled C++ classes can be overloaded in Python, without the need to re-compile the full framework. This allows for automated, dynamic model (or sub-model) generation, for example using a mark-up language based input file. Given the variety of modelling paradigms and large number of input parameters used in problems of interest, there is much potential for misuse of units. Microvessel Chaste uses low-cost compile-time unit checking to ensure dimensional consistency and automatic solver-specific non-dimensionalisation through the Boost Units framework. The latter is useful for minimising floating pointer errors during the solution of PDEs and flow problems.

\section*{Results}

In this section two sample multi-scale agent-based problems are demonstrated, and are available for reproduction following wiki-based tutorials at \url{https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/PaperTutorials/Microvessel} \footnote{Login required. Username: reviewer. Password: paper}.

\subsection*{A 2D Lattice-Based Vascular Tumour Simulation}

The first example is a 2D lattice-based vascular tumour growth simulation following from Owen \emph{et al.}~\cite{Owen2011}, but with some simplifications to reduce computational expense. This example demonstrates the feasibility of replicating a well known vascular tumour growth simulation, which is similar to many models in the literature~\cite{Anderson1998, Frieboes2007, Perfahl2011, Connor2015}. It also demonstrates how the library interfaces with the functionality of the Chaste discrete cell modelling software. Recent advances in intravital imaging allow in-vivo observation of this process at the scale of individual cells, as shown in Fig~\ref{fig3}(a)\cite{Grogan2016}.

This demonstrates the ability to image biological features at the same size-scale as the computational models. (b) A computational model of tumour growth over a period of 16 days using the Microvessel Chaste library. A planned application of the library is studying vascular patterning for comparison with observations from imaging data.}
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig~\ref{fig3}(b), the problem is initialized with two large, parallel, counter-flowing vessels, positioned on a regular lattice. A cellular automaton based cell population is used to fill all lattice sites, with `Tumour' cell types assigned to a central circular region and `Normal' types to the remainder. Due to their distance from the large vessels, cells will become hypoxic and release growth factor (VEGF). This stimulates the sprouting and migration of new vessels toward the tumour. Eventually, cells far from the vessels become apoptotic, leaving only cores of viable cells encircling oxygenated vessels. The surviving tumour cells gradually invade the regions surrounding vessels at the expense of the normal cells. The process is similar to that observed in the simulations of Perfahl \emph{et al.}~\cite{Perfahl2011}.

There are many potential additions to models of this type which have been explored in the literature, including simulated administration of chemo-therapeutic and anti-angiogeneic drugs~\cite{Alarcon2006} and radiotherapy~\cite{Grogan2016}, and the use of 3D domains~\cite{Perfahl2011}. All of these cases can be simulated using the Microvessel Chaste library.

\subsection*{A 3D Off-Lattice Angiogenesis Simulation}

The second example is a 3D off-lattice simulation of angiogenesis on a curved surface, shown in Fig~\ref{fig4}. This example demonstrates more advanced features of the library in terms of geometry manipulation, 3D off-lattice angiogenesis and the solution of PDEs on 3D domains. The application is in modelling the widely used corneal micropocket assay in the study of angiogenesis~\cite{Connor2015}, an example of which is shown in Fig~\ref{fig4}(a). In this assay a pellet containing a vessel growth stimulus (for example, VEGF) is implanted in the cornea. New vessels sprout from an existing limbal vessel at the base of the cornea and migrate toward the pellet along VEGF gradients. In this computational model discrete non-vessel cells are not included. This reduces computational expense for the purposes of generating a tutorial, and corresponds to a widely used modelling paradigm in which cells are treated as a continuum, but vessels are modelled discretely~\cite{Secomb2013}. As shown in Fig~\ref{fig4}(b), the cornea is represented as a hemispherical domain of radius 1.4 mm and thickness 0.1 mm. The pellet is a cuboid with side length 0.3 mm and a prescribed VEGF concentration of 3.0 nM. In reality the VEGF in the pellet will deplete. Vessels sprout from the limbal vessel and migrate toward the pellet, remaining within the bounds of the hemispherical shell.

(b) Application of the Microvessel Chaste library in modelling a similar experiment, but with a number of simplifications for the purposes of the tutorial. The reader is referred to Connor \emph{et al.}~\cite{Connor2015} for a more detailed model.}
\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

Extensions to this simple model include addition of discrete cells, and multiple vessel growth factors, as per the 2D model in Connor~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Connor2015}.

\section*{Availability and Future Directions}

Additional functionality for semi-automated 2D and 3D image segmentation and meshing is under development, to aid integration with experimental studies. Porting to Windows and Mac OS X are of interest, with future availability of Python packages for each likely. At present, algorithms operate in serial only, however there is scope for distributed memory parallelisation. All PDE and flow solvers are based on PETSc~\cite{Balay2014} structures and vessel network components may be communicated using existing serialization functionality in Chaste~\cite{Harvey2015} or through serialization of VTK objects~\cite{Schroeder2003}. As discussed in Mirams et al.~\cite{Mirams2013}, contributions are welcome via the main Chaste website, which includes a developer wiki, mailing list details and the ability to open and comment on work tickets.
